## The assignment

Download this repo and run this project locally. 

When you move your mouse to the right in the canvas, the scenery must turn from daylight colors to nighttime colors.

Tip: colors are also just numbers (in this sketch). So they can vary -> they can be a variable.

The result should look like this:
